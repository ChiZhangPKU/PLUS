**P**ositive and unlabeled **L**earning from **U**nbalanced cases and **S**parse structures, or PLUS, represents the first one that uses 
positive and unlabeled learning framework to account for the under detection of metastasis events in building a classifier. 
PLUS is specifically tailored for studying metastasis that deals with the unbalanced instance allocation as well as unknown metastasis prevalence,
which are not capable by any other methods. PLUS achieves the most favorable performances on synthetic datasets compared with other state-of-the-art methods.
